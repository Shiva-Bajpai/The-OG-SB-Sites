# 🔥 SB-OG Series: Building Websites like Never Seen Before.

Welcome to the **SB-OG Series**, where I challenge myself to **build websites from scratch** using modern web development techniques. This series features a collection of original websites designed and developed to showcase clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces.

## 🎯 Objective

The **SB-OG Series** aims to:
- Build original websites from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks.
- Implement responsive designs and smooth interactions for a seamless user experience.
- Experiment with creative layouts and functionalities to improve web development skills.
- Showcase my understanding of design principles, user-centric design, and best coding practices.
